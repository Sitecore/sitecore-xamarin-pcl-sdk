## Dive in

As the SDK is designed as a portable class library (PCL), you can use the same code on all platforms to fetch the default "home" item content. 

```csharp
using (var credentials = new SecureStringPasswordProvider("admin", "b")) // providing secure credentials
using 
(
  var session = SitecoreWebApiSessionBuilder.AuthenticatedSessionWithHost(instanceUrl)
    .Credentials(credentials)
    .WebApiVersion("v1")
    .DefaultDatabase("web")
    .DefaultLanguage("en")
    .MediaLibraryRoot("/sitecore/media library")
    .MediaPrefix("~/media/")
    .DefaultMediaResourceExtension("ashx")
    .BuildSession()
) // Creating a session from credentials, instance URL and settings
{
  // In order to fetch some data we have to build a request
  var request = ItemWebApiRequestBuilder.ReadItemsRequestWithPath("/sitecore/content/home")
  .AddFieldsToRead("text")
  .AddScope(ScopeType.Self)
  .Build();

  // And execute it on a session asynchronously
  var response = await session.ReadItemAsync(request);

  // Now that it has succeeded we are able to access downloaded items
  ISitecoreItem item = response[0];

  // And content stored it its fields
  string fieldContent = item["text"].RawValue;
}
```
